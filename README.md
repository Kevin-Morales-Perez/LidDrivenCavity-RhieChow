# LidDrivenCavity-RhieChow
Finite Volume MATLAB solver for lid-driven cavity using SIMPLE and Rhie-Chow interpolation

# Lid-Driven Cavity Solver using Rhie–Chow (MATLAB)

This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of a 2D incompressible laminar flow solver for the lid-driven cavity problem using:

- Finite Volume Method
- SIMPLE algorithm for pressure–velocity coupling
- Rhie–Chow interpolation for collocated grids
- Gauss–Seidel iterative and GMRES solvers with under-relaxation

## Features

- Structured collocated mesh
- Face velocity interpolation (Rhie–Chow)
-  post-processing



## How to run

Run in Matlab or Octave Lid_driven_cavity.m
